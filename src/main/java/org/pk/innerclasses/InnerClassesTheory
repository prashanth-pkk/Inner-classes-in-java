1. Static Inner Class:
    A. When you need to associate a class with its outer class but don’t need access to the outer class's instance members.
        For example, when creating a node in a data structure like a LinkedList or BinaryTree.
    B. When the inner class doesn’t depend on the instance of the outer class.
        This is useful when creating utility classes that don't need to interact with the outer class's instance variables.
    C. When you want to create a helper class that can be instantiated independently of the outer class instance.
        A good example is the Node class in a linked list or tree, where nodes are generally independent of the specific instance of the list or tree.
2. Local Inner Class:
    Local inner classes are typically used in asynchronous operations, like network requests, where a callback function is required once the task is done.
3. Member Inner Class:
    This scenario is common in server-side applications or background tasks where threads perform operations and interact with instance variables of the outer class.
4. Anonymous Inner Class:
    A. Callback Mechanisms: In situations where a function or method requires a callback, anonymous inner classes are used to define the callback behavior without the need for creating a separate class.
        For example, callbacks in network operations or asynchronous tasks.
    B. Threading: Anonymous inner classes are often used in multi-threading scenarios, especially when you want to override a method from a class (like Thread) or implement an interface (like Runnable) in a short and concise way.
    C. Strategy Pattern or Command Pattern: When you need to pass different behaviors dynamically (i.e., concrete implementations of an interface), anonymous inner classes can provide a convenient and concise way to define the behavior in-place.
